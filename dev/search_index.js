CoordinatedSupplyChains.jl is intended for users who want to solve supply chain problems under a coordination objective (i.e., supply chains as coordinated markets). It is intended to function equally well for users in practical settings (industrial practitioners) and for educators looking to teach complex operations research concepts. CoordinatedSupplyChains.jl is built around a coordination model abstraction; users only need to supply properly formatted data files to the package, CoordinatedSupplyChains.jl parses these into the model, solves the user-defined supply chain problem, and returns all the output variables to the user, along with model statistics, and a standardized network plot.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"CoordinatedSupplyChains.jl is a registered Julia package.
