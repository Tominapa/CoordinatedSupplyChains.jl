It is built on the concept of supply chain economics, with prices driving transactions between supply chain stakeholders. In other words, with this approach, if a supply chain delivers a product to a customer, it is because it is profitable to do so. Under this economic interpretation, a supply chain is treated as a collection of stakeholders, including product suppliers, consumers, transportation, processing technologies, and environmental impact sinks. This conceptualization makes CoordinatedSupplyChains.jl particularly useful for analysis of sustainability-profit trade-offs.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"CoordinatedSupplyChains.jl encodes a complex abstraction for large-scale supply chains into a simple, user-friendly interface that removes almost all the coding burden separating the user from the results.

This coordination system is managed by a coordinator, an independent operator who does not have a stake in the market, but whose goal is to maximize the total profit of the market. The stakeholders pass their bidding information to the coordinator, who resolves the market by setting product and service prices. As a result, transactions of products and services are allocated to stakeholders. The coordination system has a number of useful theoretical guarantees related to the coordinator's price setting practices and the implications for supply chain stakeholders.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/","page":"Tutorials","title":"Tutorials","text":"No stakeholder loses money as a result of participation in the coordination system. A stakeholder either participates in the market with a positive allocation and nonnegative profit, or it does not participate in the market at all. Market participation is never coerced.\nThe coordinator's prices respect participating stakeholder bids. This is the mechanism by which nonnegative profits are guaranteed.\nCoordination is efficient; there is no money lost to the coordinator or from the supply chain as a result of operating under the coordination system. In other words, money balances within a coordinated supply chain.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/","page":"Tutorials","title":"Tutorials","text":"For a complete review of the auction system, please refer to the associated references.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/#Supply-Chain-Representation","page":"Tutorials","title":"Supply Chain Representation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorial/","page":"Tutorials","title":"Tutorials","text":"CoordinatedSupplyChains.jl uses a compact graph representation to describe a supply chain.

Similarly, you may wish to build supply chain problems with no arcs; the package will accommodate this as well. For models with no sustainability focus, the impact and environmental stakeholder data folders may be excluded. Similarly, if there are no technologies, then the technology and mapping files may be excluded.
