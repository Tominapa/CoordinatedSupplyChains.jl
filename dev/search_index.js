CoordinatedSupplyChains.jl is intended for users who want to solve supply chain problems under a coordination objective (i.e., supply chains as coordinated markets). It is intended to function equally well for users in practical settings (industrial practitioners) and for educators looking to teach complex operations research concepts. CoordinatedSupplyChains.jl is built around a coordination model abstraction; users only need to supply properly formatted data files to the package, CoordinatedSupplyChains.jl parses these into the model, solves the user-defined supply chain problem, and returns all the output variables to the user, along with model statistics, and a standardized network plot.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"CoordinatedSupplyChains.jl is a registered Julia package.

In this work, a supply chain is conceptualized as a market operating under a coordination system managed by in Independent System Operator (ISO). Coordination proceeds much like an auction, the ISO collects bidding information from supply chain stakeholders, and determines transactions which maximize the combined total profit of all stakeholders. In this framework, every stakeholder in the supply chain is categorized into one of four classes: a supplier, a consumer, a technology (or transformation) provider, or a transportation provider. Briefly, each of these stakeholders is responsible for a specific task in a supply chain.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/","page":"Tutorials","title":"Tutorials","text":"Suppliers sell products\nConsumers buy products\nTechnology providers convert one set of products into a different set of products\nTransportation providers move products between supply chain locations.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/","page":"Tutorials","title":"Tutorials","text":"Each of these stakeholders is an independent profit-maximizing entity in a supply chain, meaning that it seeks to maximize its profits independently of other supply chain stakeholders. Each stakeholder has associated with it a capacity parameter indicating the extent to which it will serve in the supply chain, as well as a service bid indicating how much the stakeholder pays or demands to be paid for its service. 'CoordinatedSupplyChains.jl' tracks the profit accrued by each stakeholder. Profits are a function of supply chain allocations and prices determined by the ISO. The term allocation is used to represent the amount of a stakeholder's capacity that it wins in the coordination process.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/","page":"Tutorials","title":"Tutorials","text":"A supplier's allocation is the amount of a product that it is able to sell\nA consumer's allocation is the amount of a product that it is able to buy\nA technology provider's allocation is the amount of a product that is able to process\nA transportation provider's allocation is the amount of a product it is able to move","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/","page":"Tutorials","title":"Tutorials","text":"Like an auction, stakeholders can only expect to receive positive allocations if they bid competitively in the coordination system. For example, a supplier can bid no more than a consumer is willing to pay, or else there is no transaction that the ISO can set up that will generate profit. Similarly, if a consumer and supplier are separated by distance, or a consumer desires a product that must be processed by some technology provider, then the consumer must be willing to bid higher than the combined cost of all the other stakeholders' bids. Within this framework, it is logically consistent for consumers to bid a negative amount (i.e., demanding to be paid to consume a product) and for suppliers to bid a negative amount (i.e., paying to have a product taken away). However, technology and transportation providers are expected to have positive bids.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/#Graph-Structure","page":"Tutorials","title":"Graph Structure","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorial/","page":"Tutorials","title":"Tutorials","text":"'CoordinatedSupplyChains.jl' uses a graph representation for supply chains consisting of nodes (representing geographical locations) and arcs (representing available pathways between nodes). Stakeholders are connected to the supply chain by association with a graph node (in the case of suppliers, consumers, and technology providers) or association with an arc (for transportation providers).
